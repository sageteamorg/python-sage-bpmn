## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository on GitHub**:

   Go to the [python-sage-bpmn](https://github.com/your-username/python-sage-bpmn) repository and click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.

2. **Clone your fork locally**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-sage-bpmn.git
   cd python-sage-bpmn
   ```

3. **Install dependencies using Poetry**:

   If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

## Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Code Style

We use `black` and `isort` to format our code. Please ensure your code is formatted correctly before submitting a pull request:

```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
```

Additionally, we use `flake8` and `pylint` for linting. You can run these tools to check for code style issues:

```bash
poetry run flake8
poetry run pylint django_sage_email
```

## Security Checks

We use `bandit` to perform security checks on our codebase. Bandit helps identify common security issues in Python code.

### Running Bandit

To run Bandit with the current configuration:

```bash
poetry run bandit -c pyproject.toml
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use `pre-commit` to ensure code quality and consistency. Pre-commit hooks will run automatically before each commit to check and format the code.

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

1. **Install pre-commit**:

   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install the pre-commit hooks**:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Run pre-commit hooks manually (optional but recommended before committing)**:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

The pre-commit configuration is defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Make sure to review and understand the hooks configured.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes**:

   Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow the guidelines in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification if possible.

   ```bash
   git commit -am 'feat: add new email feature'
   ```

2. **Push to the branch**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Open a pull request on GitHub**:

   Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request. Link to any relevant issues or discussions.

4. **Wait for review**:

   One of the project maintainers will review your pull request. Be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make changes if necessary.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the issue:

1. **Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/python-sage-bpmn/issues) section of the repository.**
2. **Click on "New issue".**
3. **Fill out the issue template with relevant details.**
